# cryptography-demonstration
Includes implementations of several cryptographic algorithms in Python 3
Created as part of a demonstration for a presentation at Belmont University

# Getting Started
1. Download the whole repository or any of the independant Python files
2. The top comments of the files have important general information about the respective cryptographic algorithm as well as links to where you can find more information
3. Run the main() method to see the algorithm at work, or customize/use the algorithm for whatever specific purpose you need
